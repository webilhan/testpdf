            <ol>
                <li>The QAP must have work practices and adequate security to prevent the escape of live animals, or any part or product of an animal from which another animal could be produced.<br/>This includes the use of insect cages or other suitable equipment for the containment of all mosquito life stages within the nominated QAP. All insect cages and equipment used within the nominated QAP must be checked regularly for maintenance and repair.</li>
                <li>The importer is responsible for ensuring that all insects are monitored for signs of abnormalities including the presence of pests, pathogens or other signs of exotic disease. If any abnormalities are present, or if following rearing of the mosquito eggs the species is not that identified on the import permit, it is the importer’s responsibility to notify the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources immediately. </li>
                <li>The imported material (including direct and indirect derivatives), must remain in the nominated QAP and must not be removed from these premises without the prior written approval of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources.</li>
                <li>
                    The following material is approved for removal from the nominated QAP(s):

                <li>The importer is responsible for ensuring compliance with any conditions that may be applicable to the use of viruses and/or parasites that have been imported into Australia (under a separate import permit). This may include obtaining written permission from the Department of Agriculture Biological Imports Program in Canberra.</li>
                <li>The QAP is responsible for maintaining records on the approximate number of insects within the facility; type of research conducted; health condition of the insects; and any transfers or disposals of imported material (including direct and indirect derivatives) These records may be subject to audit.</li>
                <li>It is the end user’s responsibility to ensure that all laboratory products are used in accordance with the current AS/NZS 2243 Safety in Laboratory standards and Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) requirements.</li>
